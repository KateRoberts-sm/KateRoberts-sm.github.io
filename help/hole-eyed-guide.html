        <h2>How to avoid a Hole-Eyed</h2>
        Hole-Eyeds are a dangerous <a href="./letmeout.mp4">species</a>, and can be the cause of most fatalites in the Smith Mountains. Do. Not. Engage. If you encounter one, stop and slowly back away. Attempt to avoid making noises of any type. <a href="https://tx-sm-re-fac.github.io/home.html">Texas Smith Mountains Research Facility</a> is not responsible for any fatalities caused by anything in the Smith Mountains.

        <br>
        If you are in a pursuit, run. Hole-Eyeds may be fast, but when chasing a snack, they will only avoid trees. Anything on the ground that can trip them will not be noticed, causing tons of stumbling. Dropping objects to obstruct a Hole-Eyed's path is encouraged. If you make your way to an Organ Tree, hide under it. Organ Fruits are poisonous to Hole-Eyeds, including just the smell of them. Wait until they are around 10 yards away from you before running away again. This is the edge of their hearing, allowing you a quiet escape.

        <br>
        In the case that you are cornered, attempt to intimidate the Hole-Eyed. Make yourself look big and loud. A Hole-Eyed may attempt to attack, but more carefully, relying on getting you to get into a fatal position where you may fall and die. Keep doing this while inching away to an area you can continue running.

        If at a cliff, then give up. You've lost this fight,
